# SWlabels

SWLabels is a tool for conveniently printing text on [SpriteWidget](https://github.com/spritewidget/spritewidget) objects

It is very convenient for use in the following cases:
- for debugging when it is more convenient to see information directly on the screen, instead of using logs or a debugger
- to temporarily display the state of the application (for example, the score and life in games), while the graphics are not yet developed

You can also see an [example](https://github.com/iLnaar/swlabels_example) of using SWLabels.
A screenshot is taken from this example:
